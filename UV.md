uv run
Run a command or script.

Ensures that the command runs in a Python environment.

When used with a file ending in .py or an HTTP(S) URL, the file will be treated as a script and run with a Python interpreter, i.e., uv run file.py is equivalent to uv run python file.py. For URLs, the script is temporarily downloaded before execution. If the script contains inline dependency metadata, it will be installed into an isolated, ephemeral environment. When used with -, the input will be read from stdin, and treated as a Python script.

When used in a project, the project environment will be created and updated before invoking the command.

When used outside a project, if a virtual environment can be found in the current directory or a parent directory, the command will be run in that environment. Otherwise, the command will be run in the environment of the discovered interpreter.

Arguments following the command (or script) are not interpreted as arguments to uv. All options to uv must be provided before the command, e.g., uv run --verbose foo. A -- can be used to separate the command from uv options for clarity, e.g., uv run --python 3.12 -- python.

Usage

uv run [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
Options
--active
Prefer the active virtual environment over the project's virtual environment.

If the project virtual environment is active or no virtual environment is active, this has no effect.

--all-extras
Include all optional dependencies.

Optional dependencies are defined via project.optional-dependencies in a pyproject.toml.

This option is only available when running in a project.

--all-groups
Include dependencies from all dependency groups.

--no-group can be used to exclude specific groups.

--all-packages
Run the command with all workspace members installed.

The workspace's environment (.venv) is updated to include all workspace members.

Any extras or groups specified via --extra, --group, or related options will be applied to all workspace members.

--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
never: Disables colored output
--compile-bytecode, --compile
Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (.py) files to bytecode (__pycache__/*.pyc); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE environment variable.

--config-file config-file
The path to a uv.toml file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a pyproject.toml file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the UV_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.

--config-setting, --config-settings, -C config-setting
Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as KEY=VALUE pairs

--default-index default-index
The URL of the default package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --index flag.

May also be set with the UV_DEFAULT_INDEX environment variable.

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--env-file env-file
Load environment variables from a .env file.

Can be provided multiple times, with subsequent files overriding values defined in previous files.

May also be set with the UV_ENV_FILE environment variable.

--exact
Perform an exact sync, removing extraneous packages.

When enabled, uv will remove any extraneous packages from the environment. By default, uv run will make the minimum necessary changes to satisfy the requirements.

--exclude-newer exclude-newer
Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., 2006-12-02T02:07:43Z) and local dates in the same format (e.g., 2006-12-02) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER environment variable.

--extra extra
Include optional dependencies from the specified extra name.

May be provided more than once.

Optional dependencies are defined via project.optional-dependencies in a pyproject.toml.

This option is only available when running in a project.

--extra-index-url extra-index-url
(Deprecated: use --index instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to --index-url.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --index-url (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --extra-index-url flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--find-links, -f find-links
Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (.whl) or source distributions (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--fork-strategy fork-strategy
The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (requires-python), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under fewest, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the UV_FORK_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

fewest: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
requires-python: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version
--frozen
Run without updating the uv.lock file.

Instead of checking if the lockfile is up-to-date, uses the versions in the lockfile as the source of truth. If the lockfile is missing, uv will exit with an error. If the pyproject.toml includes changes to dependencies that have not been included in the lockfile yet, they will not be present in the environment.

May also be set with the UV_FROZEN environment variable.

--group group
Include dependencies from the specified dependency group.

May be provided multiple times.

--gui-script
Run the given path as a Python GUI script.

Using --gui-script will attempt to parse the path as a PEP 723 script and run it with pythonw.exe, irrespective of its extension. Only available on Windows.

--help, -h
Display the concise help for this command

--index index
The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --extra-index-url flag.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--isolated
Run the command in an isolated virtual environment.

Usually, the project environment is reused for performance. This option forces a fresh environment to be used for the project, enforcing strict isolation between dependencies and declaration of requirements.

An editable installation is still used for the project.

When used with --with or --with-requirements, the additional dependencies will still be layered in a second environment.

--keyring-provider keyring-provider
Attempt to use keyring for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only --keyring-provider subprocess is supported, which configures uv to use the keyring CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to disabled.

May also be set with the UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER environment variable.

Possible values:

disabled: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
subprocess: Use the keyring command for credential lookup
--link-mode link-mode
The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to clone (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and hardlink on Linux and Windows.

May also be set with the UV_LINK_MODE environment variable.

Possible values:

clone: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
copy: Copy packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
hardlink: Hard link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
symlink: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
--locked
Assert that the uv.lock will remain unchanged.

Requires that the lockfile is up-to-date. If the lockfile is missing or needs to be updated, uv will exit with an error.

May also be set with the UV_LOCKED environment variable.

--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--module, -m
Run a Python module.

Equivalent to python -m <module>.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-binary
Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BINARY environment variable.

--no-binary-package no-binary-package
Don't install pre-built wheels for a specific package

May also be set with the UV_NO_BINARY_PACKAGE environment variable.

--no-build

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD environment variable.

--no-build-isolation
Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION environment variable.

Don't build source distributions for a specific package

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD_PACKAGE environment variable.

--no-cache, --no-cache-dir, -n
Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the UV_NO_CACHE environment variable.

--no-config
Avoid discovering configuration files (pyproject.toml, uv.toml).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the UV_NO_CONFIG environment variable.

--no-default-groups
Ignore the default dependency groups.

uv includes the groups defined in tool.uv.default-groups by default. This disables that option, however, specific groups can still be included with --group.

--no-dev
Disable the development dependency group.

This option is an alias of --no-group dev. See --no-default-groups to disable all default groups instead.

This option is only available when running in a project.

--no-editable
Install any editable dependencies, including the project and any workspace members, as non-editable

May also be set with the UV_NO_EDITABLE environment variable.

--no-group no-group
Disable the specified dependency group.

This option always takes precedence over default groups, --all-groups, and --group.

May be provided multiple times.

--no-index
Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via --find-links

--no-managed-python
Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--no-progress
Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the UV_NO_PROGRESS environment variable.

--no-project, --no_workspace
Avoid discovering the project or workspace.

Instead of searching for projects in the current directory and parent directories, run in an isolated, ephemeral environment populated by the --with requirements.

If a virtual environment is active or found in a current or parent directory, it will be used as if there was no project or workspace.

--no-python-downloads
Disable automatic downloads of Python.

--no-sources
Ignore the tool.uv.sources table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

--no-sync
Avoid syncing the virtual environment.

Implies --frozen, as the project dependencies will be ignored (i.e., the lockfile will not be updated, since the environment will not be synced regardless).

May also be set with the UV_NO_SYNC environment variable.

--offline
Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

The project and its dependencies will be omitted.

May be provided multiple times. Implies --no-default-groups.

--package package
Run the command in a specific package in the workspace.

If the workspace member does not exist, uv will exit with an error.

--prerelease prerelease
The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that only publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (if-necessary-or-explicit).

May also be set with the UV_PRERELEASE environment variable.

Possible values:

disallow: Disallow all pre-release versions
allow: Allow all pre-release versions
if-necessary: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
explicit: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
if-necessary-or-explicit: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements
--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--python, -p python
The Python interpreter to use for the run environment.

If the interpreter request is satisfied by a discovered environment, the environment will be used.

See uv python to view supported request formats.

May also be set with the UV_PYTHON environment variable.

--resolution resolution
The strategy to use when selecting between the different compatible versions for a given package requirement.

By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (highest).

May also be set with the UV_RESOLUTION environment variable.

Possible values:

highest: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
lowest: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
lowest-direct: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies
--script, -s
Run the given path as a Python script.

Using --script will attempt to parse the path as a PEP 723 script, irrespective of its extension.

--upgrade, -U
Allow package upgrades, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file. Implies --refresh

--upgrade-package, -P upgrade-package
Allow upgrades for a specific package, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file. Implies --refresh-package

The same environment semantics as --with apply.

Using pyproject.toml, setup.py, or setup.cfg files is not allowed.

uv init
Create a new project.

Follows the pyproject.toml specification.

If a pyproject.toml already exists at the target, uv will exit with an error.

If a pyproject.toml is found in any of the parent directories of the target path, the project will be added as a workspace member of the parent.

Some project state is not created until needed, e.g., the project virtual environment (.venv) and lockfile (uv.lock) are lazily created during the first sync.

Usage

uv init [OPTIONS] [PATH]
Arguments
PATH
The path to use for the project/script.

Defaults to the current working directory when initializing an app or library; required when initializing a script. Accepts relative and absolute paths.

If a pyproject.toml is found in any of the parent directories of the target path, the project will be added as a workspace member of the parent, unless --no-workspace is provided.

Options
--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--app, --application
Create a project for an application.

This is the default behavior if --lib is not requested.

This project kind is for web servers, scripts, and command-line interfaces.

By default, an application is not intended to be built and distributed as a Python package. The --package option can be used to create an application that is distributable, e.g., if you want to distribute a command-line interface via PyPI.

--author-from author-from
Fill in the authors field in the pyproject.toml.

By default, uv will attempt to infer the author information from some sources (e.g., Git) (auto). Use --author-from git to only infer from Git configuration. Use --author-from none to avoid inferring the author information.

Possible values:

auto: Fetch the author information from some sources (e.g., Git) automatically
git: Fetch the author information from Git configuration only
none: Do not infer the author information
--bare
Only create a pyproject.toml.

Disables creating extra files like README.md, the src/ tree, .python-version files, etc.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
never: Disables colored output
--config-file config-file
The path to a uv.toml file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a pyproject.toml file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the UV_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.

--name name
The name of the project.

Defaults to the name of the directory.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

Does not include a [build-system] for the project.

This is the default behavior when using --app.

--no-pin-python
Do not create a .python-version file for the project.

By default, uv will create a .python-version file containing the minor version of the discovered Python interpreter, which will cause subsequent uv commands to use that version.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--package
Set up the project to be built as a Python package.

Defines a [build-system] for the project.

This is the default behavior when using --lib or --build-backend.

When using --app, this will include a [project.scripts] entrypoint and use a src/ project structure.

--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--python, -p python
The Python interpreter to use to determine the minimum supported Python version.

See uv python to view supported request formats.

May also be set with the UV_PYTHON environment variable.

--quiet, -q
Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., -qq, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

--script
Create a script.

A script is a standalone file with embedded metadata enumerating its dependencies, along with any Python version requirements, as defined in the PEP 723 specification.

PEP 723 scripts can be executed directly with uv run.

By default, adds a requirement on the system Python version; use --python to specify an alternative Python version requirement.

--vcs vcs
Initialize a version control system for the project.

By default, uv will initialize a Git repository (git). Use --vcs none to explicitly avoid initializing a version control system.

Possible values:

git: Use Git for version control
none: Do not use any version control system
--verbose, -v
Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the RUST_LOG environment variable. (https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives)

uv add
Add dependencies to the project.

Dependencies are added to the project's pyproject.toml file.

If a given dependency exists already, it will be updated to the new version specifier unless it includes markers that differ from the existing specifier in which case another entry for the dependency will be added.

The lockfile and project environment will be updated to reflect the added dependencies. To skip updating the lockfile, use --frozen. To skip updating the environment, use --no-sync.

If any of the requested dependencies cannot be found, uv will exit with an error, unless the --frozen flag is provided, in which case uv will add the dependencies verbatim without checking that they exist or are compatible with the project.

uv will search for a project in the current directory or any parent directory. If a project cannot be found, uv will exit with an error.

Usage

uv add [OPTIONS] <PACKAGES|--requirements <REQUIREMENTS>>
Arguments
PACKAGES
The packages to add, as PEP 508 requirements (e.g., ruff==0.5.0)

Options
--active
Prefer the active virtual environment over the project's virtual environment.

If the project virtual environment is active or no virtual environment is active, this has no effect.

--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--bounds bounds
The kind of version specifier to use when adding dependencies.

When adding a dependency to the project, if no constraint or URL is provided, a constraint is added based on the latest compatible version of the package. By default, a lower bound constraint is used, e.g., >=1.2.3.

When --frozen is provided, no resolution is performed, and dependencies are always added without constraints.

This option is in preview and may change in any future release.

Possible values:

lower: Only a lower bound, e.g., >=1.2.3
major: Allow the same major version, similar to the semver caret, e.g., >=1.2.3, <2.0.0
minor: Allow the same minor version, similar to the semver tilde, e.g., >=1.2.3, <1.3.0
exact: Pin the exact version, e.g., ==1.2.3
--branch branch
Branch to use when adding a dependency from Git

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
never: Disables colored output
--compile-bytecode, --compile
Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (.py) files to bytecode (__pycache__/*.pyc); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE environment variable.

--config-file config-file
The path to a uv.toml file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a pyproject.toml file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the UV_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.

--config-setting, --config-settings, -C config-setting
Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as KEY=VALUE pairs

--constraints, --constraint, -c constraints
Constrain versions using the given requirements files.

Constraints files are requirements.txt-like files that only control the version of a requirement that's installed. The constraints will not be added to the project's pyproject.toml file, but will be respected during dependency resolution.

This is equivalent to pip's --constraint option.

May also be set with the UV_CONSTRAINT environment variable.

--default-index default-index
The URL of the default package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --index flag.

May also be set with the UV_DEFAULT_INDEX environment variable.

--dev
Add the requirements to the development dependency group.

This option is an alias for --group dev.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--editable
Add the requirements as editable

--exclude-newer exclude-newer
Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., 2006-12-02T02:07:43Z) and local dates in the same format (e.g., 2006-12-02) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER environment variable.

--extra extra
Extras to enable for the dependency.

May be provided more than once.

To add this dependency to an optional extra instead, see --optional.

--extra-index-url extra-index-url
(Deprecated: use --index instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to --index-url.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --index-url (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --extra-index-url flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--find-links, -f find-links
Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (.whl) or source distributions (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--fork-strategy fork-strategy
The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (requires-python), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under fewest, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the UV_FORK_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

fewest: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
requires-python: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version
--frozen
Add dependencies without re-locking the project.

The project environment will not be synced.

May also be set with the UV_FROZEN environment variable.

These requirements will not be included in the published metadata for the project.

--help, -h
Display the concise help for this command

--index index
The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --extra-index-url flag.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--keyring-provider keyring-provider
Attempt to use keyring for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only --keyring-provider subprocess is supported, which configures uv to use the keyring CLI to handle authentication.

Possible values:

disabled: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
subprocess: Use the keyring command for credential lookup
--link-mode link-mode

May also be set with the UV_LOCKED environment variable.

--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--marker, -m marker
Apply this marker to all added packages

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-binary
Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., -qq, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

--raw, --raw-sources
Add a dependency as provided.

By default, uv will use the tool.uv.sources section to record source information for Git, local, editable, and direct URL requirements. When --raw is provided, uv will add source requirements to project.dependencies, rather than tool.uv.sources.

Additionally, by default, uv will add bounds to your dependency, e.g., foo>=1.0.0. When --raw is provided, uv will add the dependency without bounds.

uv remove
Remove dependencies from the project.

Dependencies are removed from the project's pyproject.toml file.

If multiple entries exist for a given dependency, i.e., each with different markers, all of the entries will be removed.

The lockfile and project environment will be updated to reflect the removed dependencies. To skip updating the lockfile, use --frozen. To skip updating the environment, use --no-sync.

If any of the requested dependencies are not present in the project, uv will exit with an error.

If a package has been manually installed in the environment, i.e., with uv pip install, it will not be removed by uv remove.

uv will search for a project in the current directory or any parent directory. If a project cannot be found, uv will exit with an error.

Usage

uv version
Read or update the project's version

Usage

uv version [OPTIONS] [VALUE]
Arguments
VALUE
Set the project version to this value

To update the project using semantic versioning components instead, use --bump.

Options
--active
Prefer the active virtual environment over the project's virtual environment.

If the project virtual environment is active or no virtual environment is active, this has no effect.

--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--bump bump
Update the project version using the given semantics

Possible values:

major: Increase the major version (1.2.3 => 2.0.0)
minor: Increase the minor version (1.2.3 => 1.3.0)
patch: Increase the patch version (1.2.3 => 1.2.4)
--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
never: Disables colored output
--compile-bytecode, --compile
Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (.py) files to bytecode (__pycache__/*.pyc); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE environment variable.

--config-file config-file
The path to a uv.toml file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a pyproject.toml file, it is not allowed in this context.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --index flag.

May also be set with the UV_DEFAULT_INDEX environment variable.

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--dry-run
Don't write a new version to the pyproject.toml

Instead, the version will be displayed.

--exclude-newer exclude-newer
Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., 2006-12-02T02:07:43Z) and local dates in the same format (e.g., 2006-12-02) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER environment variable.

--extra-index-url extra-index-url
(Deprecated: use --index instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to --index-url.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --index-url (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --extra-index-url flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--find-links, -f find-links
Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (.whl) or source distributions (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip) at the top level.

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--fork-strategy fork-strategy
The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (requires-python), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under fewest, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the UV_FORK_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

fewest: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
requires-python: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version
--frozen
Update the version without re-locking the project.

The project environment will not be synced.

May also be set with the UV_FROZEN environment variable.

--help, -h
Display the concise help for this command

--index index
The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --extra-index-url flag.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--keyring-provider keyring-provider
Attempt to use keyring for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only --keyring-provider subprocess is supported, which configures uv to use the keyring CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to disabled.

May also be set with the UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER environment variable.

Possible values:

disabled: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
subprocess: Use the keyring command for credential lookup
--link-mode link-mode
The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to clone (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and hardlink on Linux and Windows.

Requires that the lockfile is up-to-date. If the lockfile is missing or needs to be updated, uv will exit with an error.

May also be set with the UV_LOCKED environment variable.

--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-binary
Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

--prerelease prerelease
The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that only publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (if-necessary-or-explicit).

May also be set with the UV_PRERELEASE environment variable.

Possible values:

disallow: Disallow all pre-release versions
allow: Allow all pre-release versions
if-necessary: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
explicit: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
if-necessary-or-explicit: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements
--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

uv sync
Update the project's environment.

Syncing ensures that all project dependencies are installed and up-to-date with the lockfile.

By default, an exact sync is performed: uv removes packages that are not declared as dependencies of the project. Use the --inexact flag to keep extraneous packages. Note that if an extraneous package conflicts with a project dependency, it will still be removed. Additionally, if --no-build-isolation is used, uv will not remove extraneous packages to avoid removing possible build dependencies.

If the project virtual environment (.venv) does not exist, it will be created.

The project is re-locked before syncing unless the --locked or --frozen flag is provided.

uv will search for a project in the current directory or any parent directory. If a project cannot be found, uv will exit with an error.

Note that, when installing from a lockfile, uv will not provide warnings for yanked package versions.

Usage

--all-groups
Include dependencies from all dependency groups.

--no-group can be used to exclude specific groups.

--all-packages
Sync all packages in the workspace.

The workspace's environment (.venv) is updated to include all workspace members.

Any extras or groups specified via --extra, --group, or related options will be applied to all workspace members.

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_NO_EDITABLE environment variable.

--no-extra no-extra
Exclude the specified optional dependencies, if --all-extras is supplied.

May be provided multiple times.

--no-group no-group
Disable the specified dependency group.

This option always takes precedence over default groups, --all-groups, and --group.

May be provided multiple times.

--no-index
Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via --find-links

--no-install-package no-install-package
Do not install the given package(s).

By default, all of the project's dependencies are installed into the environment. The --no-install-package option allows exclusion of specific packages. Note this can result in a broken environment, and should be used with caution.

--no-install-project
Do not install the current project.

By default, the current project is installed into the environment with all of its dependencies. The --no-install-project option allows the project to be excluded, but all of its dependencies are still installed. This is particularly useful in situations like building Docker images where installing the project separately from its dependencies allows optimal layer caching.

--no-install-workspace
Do not install any workspace members, including the root project.

By default, all of the workspace members and their dependencies are installed into the environment. The --no-install-workspace option allows exclusion of all the workspace members while retaining their dependencies. This is particularly useful in situations like building Docker images where installing the workspace separately from its dependencies allows optimal layer caching.

--no-managed-python
Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--no-progress

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--only-dev
Only include the development dependency group.

The project and its dependencies will be omitted.

This option is an alias for --only-group dev. Implies --no-default-groups.

The project and its dependencies will be omitted.

May be provided multiple times. Implies --no-default-groups.

--package package
Sync for a specific package in the workspace.

The workspace's environment (.venv) is updated to reflect the subset of dependencies declared by the specified workspace member package.

If the workspace member does not exist, uv will exit with an error.

--prerelease prerelease
The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that only publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (if-necessary-or-explicit).

May also be set with the UV_PRERELEASE environment variable.

Possible values:

disallow: Disallow all pre-release versions
allow: Allow all pre-release versions
if-necessary: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
explicit: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
if-necessary-or-explicit: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements
--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--python, -p python
The Python interpreter to use for the project environment.

By default, the first interpreter that meets the project's requires-python constraint is used.

If a Python interpreter in a virtual environment is provided, the packages will not be synced to the given environment. The interpreter will be used to create a virtual environment in the project.

See uv python for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

May also be set with the UV_PYTHON environment variable.

--quiet, -q
Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., -qq, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

--refresh

You can configure fine-grained logging using the RUST_LOG environment variable. (https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives)

uv lock
Update the project's lockfile.

If the project lockfile (uv.lock) does not exist, it will be created. If a lockfile is present, its contents will be used as preferences for the resolution.

If there are no changes to the project's dependencies, locking will have no effect unless the --upgrade flag is provided.

Usage

uv lock [OPTIONS]
Options
--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --index flag.

May also be set with the UV_DEFAULT_INDEX environment variable.

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--dry-run
Perform a dry run, without writing the lockfile.

In dry-run mode, uv will resolve the project's dependencies and report on the resulting changes, but will not write the lockfile to disk.

--exclude-newer exclude-newer
Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., 2006-12-02T02:07:43Z) and local dates in the same format (e.g., 2006-12-02) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--fork-strategy fork-strategy
The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (requires-python), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under fewest, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the UV_FORK_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

fewest: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
requires-python: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version
--help, -h
Display the concise help for this command

--index index
The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --extra-index-url flag.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_URL environment variable.

hardlink: Hard link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
symlink: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

--config-setting, --config-settings, -C config-setting
Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as KEY=VALUE pairs

--default-index default-index
The URL of the default package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --index flag.

May also be set with the UV_DEFAULT_INDEX environment variable.

--depth, -d depth
Maximum display depth of the dependency tree

[default: 255]

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--exclude-newer exclude-newer
Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., 2006-12-02T02:07:43Z) and local dates in the same format (e.g., 2006-12-02) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER environment variable.

--extra-index-url extra-index-url
(Deprecated: use --index instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to --index-url.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --index-url (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --extra-index-url flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--find-links, -f find-links

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--fork-strategy fork-strategy
The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (requires-python), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under fewest, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the UV_FORK_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

fewest: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --extra-index-url flag.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--invert, --reverse
Show the reverse dependencies for the given package. This flag will invert the tree and display the packages that depend on the given package

--keyring-provider keyring-provider

Possible values:

disabled: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
subprocess: Use the keyring command for credential lookup
--link-mode link-mode

Possible values:

clone: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
copy: Copy packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
hardlink: Hard link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
symlink: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
--locked
Assert that the uv.lock will remain unchanged.

Requires that the lockfile is up-to-date. If the lockfile is missing or needs to be updated, uv will exit with an error.

May also be set with the UV_LOCKED environment variable.

--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-binary
Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the UV_NO_CONFIG environment variable.

--no-dedupe
Do not de-duplicate repeated dependencies. Usually, when a package has already displayed its dependencies, further occurrences will not re-display its dependencies, and will include a (*) to indicate it has already been shown. This flag will cause those duplicates to be repeated

--no-default-groups
Ignore the default dependency groups.

uv includes the groups defined in tool.uv.default-groups by default. This disables that option, however, specific groups can still be included with --group.

--no-dev
Disable the development dependency group.

By default, uv does not compile Python (.py) files to bytecode (__pycache__/*.pyc); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE environment variable.

--config-file config-file
The path to a uv.toml file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a pyproject.toml file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the UV_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.

--config-setting, --config-settings, -C config-setting
Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as KEY=VALUE pairs

--constraints, --constraint, -c constraints
Constrain versions using the given requirements files.

Constraints files are requirements.txt-like files that only control the version of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will not trigger the installation of that package.

This is equivalent to pip's --constraint option.

May also be set with the UV_CONSTRAINT environment variable.

--default-index default-index
The URL of the default package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --index flag.

May also be set with the UV_DEFAULT_INDEX environment variable.

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--env-file env-file
Load environment variables from a .env file.

Can be provided multiple times, with subsequent files overriding values defined in previous files.

May also be set with the UV_ENV_FILE environment variable.

--exclude-newer exclude-newer
Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., 2006-12-02T02:07:43Z) and local dates in the same format (e.g., 2006-12-02) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER environment variable.

--extra-index-url extra-index-url
(Deprecated: use --index instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to --index-url.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --index-url (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --extra-index-url flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--find-links, -f find-links
Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (.whl) or source distributions (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--fork-strategy fork-strategy
The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (requires-python), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under fewest, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the UV_FORK_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

fewest: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
requires-python: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version
--from from
Use the given package to provide the command.

By default, the package name is assumed to match the command name.

--help, -h
Display the concise help for this command

--index index
The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --extra-index-url flag.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--isolated
Run the tool in an isolated virtual environment, ignoring any already-installed tools

--keyring-provider keyring-provider

Defaults to disabled.

May also be set with the UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER environment variable.

Possible values:

disabled: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
subprocess: Use the keyring command for credential lookup
--link-mode link-mode
The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to clone (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and hardlink on Linux and Windows.

May also be set with the UV_LINK_MODE environment variable.

Possible values:

clone: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
copy: Copy packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
hardlink: Hard link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
symlink: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-binary
Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BINARY environment variable.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD environment variable.

--no-build-isolation
Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION environment variable.

--offline
Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--overrides, --override overrides
Override versions using the given requirements files.

Overrides files are requirements.txt-like files that force a specific version of a requirement to be installed, regardless of the requirements declared by any constituent package, and regardless of whether this would be considered an invalid resolution.

While constraints are additive, in that they're combined with the requirements of the constituent packages, overrides are absolute, in that they completely replace the requirements of the constituent packages.

May also be set with the UV_OVERRIDE environment variable.

--prerelease prerelease
The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that only publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (if-necessary-or-explicit).

May also be set with the UV_PRERELEASE environment variable.

Possible values:

disallow: Disallow all pre-release versions
allow: Allow all pre-release versions
if-necessary: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
explicit: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
if-necessary-or-explicit: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements
--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--python, -p python
The Python interpreter to use to build the run environment.

See uv python for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

May also be set with the UV_PYTHON environment variable.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
never: Disables colored output
--compile-bytecode, --compile
Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (.py) files to bytecode (__pycache__/*.pyc); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE environment variable.

--config-file config-file
The path to a uv.toml file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a pyproject.toml file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the UV_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.

--config-setting, --config-settings, -C config-setting
Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as KEY=VALUE pairs

--default-index default-index
The URL of the default package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --index flag.

May also be set with the UV_DEFAULT_INDEX environment variable.

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--exclude-newer exclude-newer
Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., 2006-12-02T02:07:43Z) and local dates in the same format (e.g., 2006-12-02) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER environment variable.

--extra-index-url extra-index-url
(Deprecated: use --index instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to --index-url.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --index-url (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --extra-index-url flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--find-links, -f find-links
Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (.whl) or source distributions (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--fork-strategy fork-strategy
The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (requires-python), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under fewest, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the UV_FORK_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

fewest: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
requires-python: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version
--help, -h
Display the concise help for this command

--index index
The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --extra-index-url flag.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--keyring-provider keyring-provider
Attempt to use keyring for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only --keyring-provider subprocess is supported, which configures uv to use the keyring CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to disabled.

May also be set with the UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER environment variable.

Possible values:

disabled: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
subprocess: Use the keyring command for credential lookup
--link-mode link-mode
The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to clone (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and hardlink on Linux and Windows.

May also be set with the UV_LINK_MODE environment variable.

Possible values:

clone: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
copy: Copy packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
hardlink: Hard link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
symlink: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-binary
Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

--no-binary-package no-binary-package
Don't install pre-built wheels for a specific package

May also be set with the UV_NO_BINARY_PACKAGE environment variable.

--no-build
Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD environment variable.

--no-build-isolation
Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION environment variable.

--no-build-isolation-package no-build-isolation-package
Disable isolation when building source distributions for a specific package.

Assumes that the packages' build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--no-progress
Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the UV_NO_PROGRESS environment variable.

--no-python-downloads

Ignore the tool.uv.sources table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

--offline
Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--prerelease prerelease
The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that only publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (if-necessary-or-explicit).

May also be set with the UV_PRERELEASE environment variable.

Possible values:

disallow: Disallow all pre-release versions
allow: Allow all pre-release versions
if-necessary: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
explicit: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
if-necessary-or-explicit: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements
--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--python, -p python
Upgrade a tool, and specify it to use the given Python interpreter to build its environment. Use with --all to apply to all tools.

See uv python for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

May also be set with the UV_PYTHON environment variable.

By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (highest).

May also be set with the UV_RESOLUTION environment variable.

Possible values:

highest: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
lowest: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
lowest-direct: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies
--verbose, -v
Use verbose output.

uv python
Manage Python versions and installations

Generally, uv first searches for Python in a virtual environment, either active or in a .venv directory in the current working directory or any parent directory. If a virtual environment is not required, uv will then search for a Python interpreter. Python interpreters are found by searching for Python executables in the PATH environment variable.

On Windows, the registry is also searched for Python executables.

By default, uv will download Python if a version cannot be found. This behavior can be disabled with the --no-python-downloads flag or the python-downloads setting.

The --python option allows requesting a different interpreter.

The following Python version request formats are supported:

<version> e.g. 3, 3.12, 3.12.3
<version-specifier> e.g. >=3.12,<3.13
<implementation> e.g. cpython or cp
<implementation>@<version> e.g. cpython@3.12
<implementation><version> e.g. cpython3.12 or cp312
<implementation><version-specifier> e.g. cpython>=3.12,<3.13
<implementation>-<version>-<os>-<arch>-<libc> e.g. cpython-3.12.3-macos-aarch64-none
Additionally, a specific system Python interpreter can often be requested with:

<executable-path> e.g. /opt/homebrew/bin/python3
<executable-name> e.g. mypython3
<install-dir> e.g. /some/environment/
When the --python option is used, normal discovery rules apply but discovered interpreters are checked for compatibility with the request, e.g., if pypy is requested, uv will first check if the virtual environment contains a PyPy interpreter then check if each executable in the path is a PyPy interpreter.

uv supports discovering CPython, PyPy, and GraalPy interpreters. Unsupported interpreters will be skipped during discovery. If an unsupported interpreter implementation is requested, uv will exit with an error.

uv python install
Download and install Python versions.

Supports CPython and PyPy. CPython distributions are downloaded from the Astral python-build-standalone project. PyPy distributions are downloaded from python.org. The available Python versions are bundled with each uv release. To install new Python versions, you may need upgrade uv.

Python versions are installed into the uv Python directory, which can be retrieved with uv python dir.

A python executable is not made globally available, managed Python versions are only used in uv commands or in active virtual environments. There is experimental support for adding Python executables to a directory on the path — use the --preview flag to enable this behavior and uv python dir --bin to retrieve the target directory.

Multiple Python versions may be requested.

See uv help python to view supported request formats.

Usage

uv python install [OPTIONS] [TARGETS]...
Arguments
TARGETS
The Python version(s) to install.

If not provided, the requested Python version(s) will be read from the UV_PYTHON environment variable then .python-versions or .python-version files.

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
never: Disables colored output
--config-file config-file

While uv configuration can be included in a pyproject.toml file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the UV_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--global
Update the global Python version pin.

Writes the pinned Python version to a .python-version file in the uv user configuration directory: XDG_CONFIG_HOME/uv on Linux/macOS and %APPDATA%/uv on Windows.

When a local Python version pin is not found in the working directory or an ancestor directory, this version will be used instead.

--help, -h

--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-cache, --no-cache-dir, -n
Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the UV_NO_CACHE environment variable.

--no-config
Avoid discovering configuration files (pyproject.toml, uv.toml).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the UV_NO_CONFIG environment variable.

--no-progress
Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the UV_NO_PROGRESS environment variable.

--no-project, --no-workspace
Avoid validating the Python pin is compatible with the project or workspace.

By default, a project or workspace is discovered in the current directory or any parent directory. If a workspace is found, the Python pin is validated against the workspace's requires-python constraint.

--no-python-downloads
Disable automatic downloads of Python.

--offline
Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--quiet, -q
Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., -qq, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

--resolved
Write the resolved Python interpreter path instead of the request.

Ensures that the exact same interpreter is used.

This option is usually not safe to use when committing the .python-version file to version control.

--rm
Remove the Python version pin

--verbose, -v
Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the RUST_LOG environment variable. (https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives)

uv python dir

--config-setting, --config-settings, -C config-setting
Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as KEY=VALUE pairs

--constraints, --constraint, -c constraints
Constrain versions using the given requirements files.

Constraints files are requirements.txt-like files that only control the version of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will not trigger the installation of that package.

This is equivalent to pip's --constraint option.

May also be set with the UV_CONSTRAINT environment variable.

May also be set with the UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER environment variable.

--extra extra
Include optional dependencies from the specified extra name; may be provided more than once.

Only applies to pyproject.toml, setup.py, and setup.cfg sources.

--extra-index-url extra-index-url
(Deprecated: use --index instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to --index-url.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --index-url (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --extra-index-url flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--find-links, -f find-links
Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (.whl) or source distributions (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--fork-strategy fork-strategy
The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (requires-python), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under fewest, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the UV_FORK_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

fewest: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
requires-python: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version
--format format
The format in which the resolution should be output.

Supports both requirements.txt and pylock.toml (PEP 751) output formats.

uv will infer the output format from the file extension of the output file, if provided. Otherwise, defaults to requirements.txt.

Possible values:

requirements.txt: Export in requirements.txt format
pylock.toml: Export in pylock.toml format
--generate-hashes
Include distribution hashes in the output file

--group group
Install the specified dependency group from a pyproject.toml.

If no path is provided, the pyproject.toml in the working directory is used.

May be provided multiple times.

--help, -h
Display the concise help for this command

--index index
The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --extra-index-url flag.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--keyring-provider keyring-provider
Attempt to use keyring for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only --keyring-provider subprocess is supported, which configures uv to use the keyring CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to disabled.

May also be set with the UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER environment variable.

Possible values:

disabled: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
subprocess: Use the keyring command for credential lookup
--link-mode link-mode
The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

This option is only used when building source distributions.

Defaults to clone (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and hardlink on Linux and Windows.

May also be set with the UV_LINK_MODE environment variable.

Possible values:

clone: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
copy: Copy packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
hardlink: Hard link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
symlink: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-annotate
Exclude comment annotations indicating the source of each package

--no-binary no-binary
Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with :all:. Clear previously specified packages with :none:.

--no-build
Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Alias for --only-binary :all:.

--no-build-isolation
Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION environment variable.

--no-build-isolation-package no-build-isolation-package
Disable isolation when building source distributions for a specific package.

Assumes that the packages' build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

--no-cache, --no-cache-dir, -n
Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the UV_NO_CACHE environment variable.

--no-deps
Ignore package dependencies, instead only add those packages explicitly listed on the command line to the resulting requirements file

--no-emit-package, --unsafe-package no-emit-package
Specify a package to omit from the output resolution. Its dependencies will still be included in the resolution. Equivalent to pip-compile's --unsafe-package option

--no-header
Exclude the comment header at the top of the generated output file

--no-index
Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via --find-links

--no-managed-python
Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--no-progress
Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the UV_NO_PROGRESS environment variable.

--no-python-downloads
Disable automatic downloads of Python.

--no-sources
Ignore the tool.uv.sources table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

--no-strip-extras
Include extras in the output file.

By default, uv strips extras, as any packages pulled in by the extras are already included as dependencies in the output file directly. Further, output files generated with --no-strip-extras cannot be used as constraints files in install and sync invocations.

--no-strip-markers
Include environment markers in the output file.

By default, uv strips environment markers, as the resolution generated by compile is only guaranteed to be correct for the target environment.

--offline
Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--only-binary only-binary
Only use pre-built wheels; don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run code from the given packages. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with :all:. Clear previously specified packages with :none:.

--output-file, -o output-file
Write the compiled requirements to the given requirements.txt or pylock.toml file.

If the file already exists, the existing versions will be preferred when resolving dependencies, unless --upgrade is also specified.

--overrides, --override overrides
Override versions using the given requirements files.

Overrides files are requirements.txt-like files that force a specific version of a requirement to be installed, regardless of the requirements declared by any constituent package, and regardless of whether this would be considered an invalid resolution.

While constraints are additive, in that they're combined with the requirements of the constituent packages, overrides are absolute, in that they completely replace the requirements of the constituent packages.

May also be set with the UV_OVERRIDE environment variable.

--prerelease prerelease
The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that only publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (if-necessary-or-explicit).

May also be set with the UV_PRERELEASE environment variable.

Possible values:

disallow: Disallow all pre-release versions
allow: Allow all pre-release versions
if-necessary: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
explicit: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
if-necessary-or-explicit: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements
--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--python, -p python
The Python interpreter to use during resolution.

A Python interpreter is required for building source distributions to determine package metadata when there are not wheels.

The interpreter is also used to determine the default minimum Python version, unless --python-version is provided.

This option respects UV_PYTHON, but when set via environment variable, it is overridden by --python-version.

See uv python for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

--python-platform python-platform
The platform for which requirements should be resolved.

Represented as a "target triple", a string that describes the target platform in terms of its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu or aarch64-apple-darwin.

When targeting macOS (Darwin), the default minimum version is 12.0. Use MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to specify a different minimum version, e.g., 13.0.

--python-version python-version
The Python version to use for resolution.

For example, 3.8 or 3.8.17.

Defaults to the version of the Python interpreter used for resolution.

Defines the minimum Python version that must be supported by the resolved requirements.

If a patch version is omitted, the minimum patch version is assumed. For example, 3.8 is mapped to 3.8.0.

--quiet, -q
Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., -qq, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

--refresh
Refresh all cached data

--refresh-package refresh-package
Refresh cached data for a specific package

--resolution resolution
The strategy to use when selecting between the different compatible versions for a given package requirement.

By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (highest).

May also be set with the UV_RESOLUTION environment variable.

Possible values:

highest: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
lowest: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
lowest-direct: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies
--system
Install packages into the system Python environment.

By default, uv uses the virtual environment in the current working directory or any parent directory, falling back to searching for a Python executable in PATH. The --system option instructs uv to avoid using a virtual environment Python and restrict its search to the system path.

May also be set with the UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON environment variable.

--torch-backend torch-backend
The backend to use when fetching packages in the PyTorch ecosystem (e.g., cpu, cu126, or auto).

When set, uv will ignore the configured index URLs for packages in the PyTorch ecosystem, and will instead use the defined backend.

For example, when set to cpu, uv will use the CPU-only PyTorch index; when set to cu126, uv will use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.6.

The auto mode will attempt to detect the appropriate PyTorch index based on the currently installed CUDA drivers.

This option is in preview and may change in any future release.

May also be set with the UV_TORCH_BACKEND environment variable.

Possible values:

auto: Select the appropriate PyTorch index based on the operating system and CUDA driver version
cpu: Use the CPU-only PyTorch index
cu128: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.8
cu126: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.6

xpu: Use the PyTorch index for Intel XPU
--universal
Perform a universal resolution, attempting to generate a single requirements.txt output file that is compatible with all operating systems, architectures, and Python implementations.

In universal mode, the current Python version (or user-provided --python-version) will be treated as a lower bound. For example, --universal --python-version 3.7 would produce a universal resolution for Python 3.7 and later.

Implies --no-strip-markers.

--upgrade, -U
Allow package upgrades, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file. Implies --refresh

--upgrade-package, -P upgrade-package
Allow upgrades for a specific package, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file. Implies --refresh-package

--verbose, -v
Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the RUST_LOG environment variable. (https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives)

uv pip sync
Sync an environment with a requirements.txt or pylock.toml file.

When syncing an environment, any packages not listed in the requirements.txt or pylock.toml file will be removed. To retain extraneous packages, use uv pip install instead.

The input file is presumed to be the output of a pip compile or uv export operation, in which it will include all transitive dependencies. If transitive dependencies are not present in the file, they will not be installed. Use --strict to warn if any transitive dependencies are missing.

Usage

uv pip sync [OPTIONS] <SRC_FILE>...
Arguments
SRC_FILE
Include all packages listed in the given requirements.txt files.

If a pyproject.toml, setup.py, or setup.cfg file is provided, uv will extract the requirements for the relevant project.

If - is provided, then requirements will be read from stdin.

Options
--allow-empty-requirements
Allow sync of empty requirements, which will clear the environment of all packages

--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--break-system-packages
Allow uv to modify an EXTERNALLY-MANAGED Python installation.

WARNING: --break-system-packages is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments, when installing into Python installations that are managed by an external package manager, like apt. It should be used with caution, as such Python installations explicitly recommend against modifications by other package managers (like uv or pip).

May also be set with the UV_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES environment variable.

--build-constraints, --build-constraint, -b build-constraints
Constrain build dependencies using the given requirements files when building source distributions.

Constraints files are requirements.txt-like files that only control the version of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will not trigger the installation of that package.

May also be set with the UV_BUILD_CONSTRAINT environment variable.

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
never: Disables colored output
--compile-bytecode, --compile
Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (.py) files to bytecode (__pycache__/*.pyc); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE environment variable.

--config-file config-file
The path to a uv.toml file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a pyproject.toml file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the UV_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.

--config-setting, --config-settings, -C config-setting
Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as KEY=VALUE pairs

--constraints, --constraint, -c constraints
Constrain versions using the given requirements files.

Constraints files are requirements.txt-like files that only control the version of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will not trigger the installation of that package.

This is equivalent to pip's --constraint option.

May also be set with the UV_CONSTRAINT environment variable.

--default-index default-index
The URL of the default package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --index flag.

May also be set with the UV_DEFAULT_INDEX environment variable.

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--dry-run
Perform a dry run, i.e., don't actually install anything but resolve the dependencies and print the resulting plan

--exclude-newer exclude-newer
Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., 2006-12-02T02:07:43Z) and local dates in the same format (e.g., 2006-12-02) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER environment variable.

--extra-index-url extra-index-url
(Deprecated: use --index instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to --index-url.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --index-url (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --extra-index-url flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--find-links, -f find-links
Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (.whl) or source distributions (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--help, -h
Display the concise help for this command

--index index
The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --extra-index-url flag.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--keyring-provider keyring-provider
Attempt to use keyring for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only --keyring-provider subprocess is supported, which configures uv to use the keyring CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to disabled.

May also be set with the UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER environment variable.

Possible values:

disabled: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
subprocess: Use the keyring command for credential lookup
--link-mode link-mode
The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to clone (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and hardlink on Linux and Windows.

May also be set with the UV_LINK_MODE environment variable.

Possible values:

clone: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
copy: Copy packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
hardlink: Hard link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
symlink: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-allow-empty-requirements
--no-binary no-binary
Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with :all:. Clear previously specified packages with :none:.

--no-break-system-packages
--no-build
Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Alias for --only-binary :all:.

--no-build-isolation
Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION environment variable.

--no-cache, --no-cache-dir, -n
Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the UV_NO_CACHE environment variable.

--no-index
Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via --find-links

--no-managed-python
Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--no-progress
Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the UV_NO_PROGRESS environment variable.

--no-python-downloads
Disable automatic downloads of Python.

--no-sources
Ignore the tool.uv.sources table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

--no-verify-hashes
Disable validation of hashes in the requirements file.

By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash. To enforce hash validation, use --require-hashes.

May also be set with the UV_NO_VERIFY_HASHES environment variable.

--offline
Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--only-binary only-binary
Only use pre-built wheels; don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run code from the given packages. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with :all:. Clear previously specified packages with :none:.

--prefix prefix
Install packages into lib, bin, and other top-level folders under the specified directory, as if a virtual environment were present at that location.

In general, prefer the use of --python to install into an alternate environment, as scripts and other artifacts installed via --prefix will reference the installing interpreter, rather than any interpreter added to the --prefix directory, rendering them non-portable.

--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--python, -p python
The Python interpreter into which packages should be installed.

By default, syncing requires a virtual environment. A path to an alternative Python can be provided, but it is only recommended in continuous integration (CI) environments and should be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

See uv python for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

May also be set with the UV_PYTHON environment variable.

--python-platform python-platform
The platform for which requirements should be installed.

Represented as a "target triple", a string that describes the target platform in terms of its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu or aarch64-apple-darwin.

When targeting macOS (Darwin), the default minimum version is 12.0. Use MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to specify a different minimum version, e.g., 13.0.

WARNING: When specified, uv will select wheels that are compatible with the target platform; as a result, the installed distributions may not be compatible with the current platform. Conversely, any distributions that are built from source may be incompatible with the target platform, as they will be built for the current platform. The --python-platform option is intended for advanced use cases.

If a patch version is omitted, the minimum patch version is assumed. For example, 3.7 is mapped to 3.7.0.

--quiet, -q
Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., -qq, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

--refresh
Refresh all cached data

--refresh-package refresh-package
Refresh cached data for a specific package

--reinstall, --force-reinstall
Reinstall all packages, regardless of whether they're already installed. Implies --refresh

--reinstall-package reinstall-package
Reinstall a specific package, regardless of whether it's already installed. Implies --refresh-package

--require-hashes
Require a matching hash for each requirement.

By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash.

When --require-hashes is enabled, all requirements must include a hash or set of hashes, and all requirements must either be pinned to exact versions (e.g., ==1.0.0), or be specified via direct URL.

Hash-checking mode introduces a number of additional constraints:

Git dependencies are not supported. - Editable installations are not supported. - Local dependencies are not supported, unless they point to a specific wheel (.whl) or source archive (.zip, .tar.gz), as opposed to a directory.
May also be set with the UV_REQUIRE_HASHES environment variable.

--strict
Validate the Python environment after completing the installation, to detect packages with missing dependencies or other issues

--system
Install packages into the system Python environment.

By default, uv installs into the virtual environment in the current working directory or any parent directory. The --system option instructs uv to instead use the first Python found in the system PATH.

WARNING: --system is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments and should be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

May also be set with the UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON environment variable.

--target target
Install packages into the specified directory, rather than into the virtual or system Python environment. The packages will be installed at the top-level of the directory

--torch-backend torch-backend
The backend to use when fetching packages in the PyTorch ecosystem (e.g., cpu, cu126, or auto).

When set, uv will ignore the configured index URLs for packages in the PyTorch ecosystem, and will instead use the defined backend.

For example, when set to cpu, uv will use the CPU-only PyTorch index; when set to cu126, uv will use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.6.

The auto mode will attempt to detect the appropriate PyTorch index based on the currently installed CUDA drivers.

This option is in preview and may change in any future release.

May also be set with the UV_TORCH_BACKEND environment variable.

Possible values:

auto: Select the appropriate PyTorch index based on the operating system and CUDA driver version
cpu: Use the CPU-only PyTorch index
cu128: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.8
cu126: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.6

uv pip install
Install packages into an environment

Usage

uv pip install [OPTIONS] <PACKAGE|--requirements <REQUIREMENTS>|--editable <EDITABLE>|--group <GROUP>>
Arguments
PACKAGE
Install all listed packages.

The order of the packages is used to determine priority during resolution.

Options
--all-extras
Include all optional dependencies.

Only applies to pyproject.toml, setup.py, and setup.cfg sources.

--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--break-system-packages
Allow uv to modify an EXTERNALLY-MANAGED Python installation.

WARNING: --break-system-packages is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments, when installing into Python installations that are managed by an external package manager, like apt. It should be used with caution, as such Python installations explicitly recommend against modifications by other package managers (like uv or pip).

May also be set with the UV_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES environment variable.

--build-constraints, --build-constraint, -b build-constraints
Constrain build dependencies using the given requirements files when building source distributions.

Constraints files are requirements.txt-like files that only control the version of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will not trigger the installation of that package.

May also be set with the UV_BUILD_CONSTRAINT environment variable.

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
never: Disables colored output
--compile-bytecode, --compile
Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (.py) files to bytecode (__pycache__/*.pyc); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE environment variable.

--config-file config-file
The path to a uv.toml file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a pyproject.toml file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the UV_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.

--config-setting, --config-settings, -C config-setting
Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as KEY=VALUE pairs

--constraints, --constraint, -c constraints
Constrain versions using the given requirements files.

Constraints files are requirements.txt-like files that only control the version of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will not trigger the installation of that package.

This is equivalent to pip's --constraint option.

May also be set with the UV_CONSTRAINT environment variable.

--default-index default-index
The URL of the default package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --index flag.

May also be set with the UV_DEFAULT_INDEX environment variable.

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--dry-run
Perform a dry run, i.e., don't actually install anything but resolve the dependencies and print the resulting plan

--editable, -e editable
Install the editable package based on the provided local file path

--exact
Perform an exact sync, removing extraneous packages.

By default, installing will make the minimum necessary changes to satisfy the requirements. When enabled, uv will update the environment to exactly match the requirements, removing packages that are not included in the requirements.

--exclude-newer exclude-newer
Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., 2006-12-02T02:07:43Z) and local dates in the same format (e.g., 2006-12-02) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER environment variable.

--extra extra
Include optional dependencies from the specified extra name; may be provided more than once.

Only applies to pyproject.toml, setup.py, and setup.cfg sources.

--extra-index-url extra-index-url
(Deprecated: use --index instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to --index-url.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --index-url (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --extra-index-url flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--find-links, -f find-links
Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (.whl) or source distributions (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--fork-strategy fork-strategy
The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (requires-python), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under fewest, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the UV_FORK_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

fewest: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
requires-python: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version
--group group
Install the specified dependency group from a pyproject.toml.

If no path is provided, the pyproject.toml in the working directory is used.

May be provided multiple times.

--help, -h
Display the concise help for this command

--index index
The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --extra-index-url flag.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--keyring-provider keyring-provider
Attempt to use keyring for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only --keyring-provider subprocess is supported, which configures uv to use the keyring CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to disabled.

May also be set with the UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER environment variable.

Possible values:

disabled: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
subprocess: Use the keyring command for credential lookup
--link-mode link-mode
The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to clone (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and hardlink on Linux and Windows.

May also be set with the UV_LINK_MODE environment variable.

Possible values:

clone: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
copy: Copy packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
hardlink: Hard link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
symlink: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-binary no-binary
Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with :all:. Clear previously specified packages with :none:.

--no-break-system-packages
--no-build
Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Alias for --only-binary :all:.

--no-build-isolation
Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION environment variable.

--no-build-isolation-package no-build-isolation-package
Disable isolation when building source distributions for a specific package.

Assumes that the packages' build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

--no-cache, --no-cache-dir, -n
Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the UV_NO_CACHE environment variable.

--no-config
Avoid discovering configuration files (pyproject.toml, uv.toml).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the UV_NO_CONFIG environment variable.

--no-deps
Ignore package dependencies, instead only installing those packages explicitly listed on the command line or in the requirements files

--no-index
Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via --find-links

--no-managed-python
Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--no-progress
Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the UV_NO_PROGRESS environment variable.

--no-python-downloads
Disable automatic downloads of Python.

--no-sources
Ignore the tool.uv.sources table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

--no-verify-hashes
Disable validation of hashes in the requirements file.

By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash. To enforce hash validation, use --require-hashes.

May also be set with the UV_NO_VERIFY_HASHES environment variable.

--offline
Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--only-binary only-binary
Only use pre-built wheels; don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run code from the given packages. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with :all:. Clear previously specified packages with :none:.

--overrides, --override overrides
Override versions using the given requirements files.

Overrides files are requirements.txt-like files that force a specific version of a requirement to be installed, regardless of the requirements declared by any constituent package, and regardless of whether this would be considered an invalid resolution.

While constraints are additive, in that they're combined with the requirements of the constituent packages, overrides are absolute, in that they completely replace the requirements of the constituent packages.

May also be set with the UV_OVERRIDE environment variable.

--prefix prefix
Install packages into lib, bin, and other top-level folders under the specified directory, as if a virtual environment were present at that location.

In general, prefer the use of --python to install into an alternate environment, as scripts and other artifacts installed via --prefix will reference the installing interpreter, rather than any interpreter added to the --prefix directory, rendering them non-portable.

--prerelease prerelease
The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that only publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (if-necessary-or-explicit).

May also be set with the UV_PRERELEASE environment variable.

Possible values:

disallow: Disallow all pre-release versions
allow: Allow all pre-release versions
if-necessary: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
explicit: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
if-necessary-or-explicit: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements
--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--python, -p python
The Python interpreter into which packages should be installed.

By default, installation requires a virtual environment. A path to an alternative Python can be provided, but it is only recommended in continuous integration (CI) environments and should be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

See uv python for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

May also be set with the UV_PYTHON environment variable.

--python-platform python-platform
The platform for which requirements should be installed.

Represented as a "target triple", a string that describes the target platform in terms of its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu or aarch64-apple-darwin.

When targeting macOS (Darwin), the default minimum version is 12.0. Use MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to specify a different minimum version, e.g., 13.0.

WARNING: When specified, uv will select wheels that are compatible with the target platform; as a result, the installed distributions may not be compatible with the current platform. Conversely, any distributions that are built from source may be incompatible with the target platform, as they will be built for the current platform. The --python-platform option is intended for advanced use cases.

Possible values:

windows: An alias for x86_64-pc-windows-msvc, the default target for Windows
linux: An alias for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, the default target for Linux
macos: An alias for aarch64-apple-darwin, the default target for macOS

wasm32-pyodide2024: A wasm32 target using the the Pyodide 2024 platform. Meant for use with Python 3.12
--python-version python-version
The minimum Python version that should be supported by the requirements (e.g., 3.7 or 3.7.9).

If a patch version is omitted, the minimum patch version is assumed. For example, 3.7 is mapped to 3.7.0.

--quiet, -q
Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., -qq, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

--refresh
Refresh all cached data

--refresh-package refresh-package
Refresh cached data for a specific package

--reinstall, --force-reinstall
Reinstall all packages, regardless of whether they're already installed. Implies --refresh

--reinstall-package reinstall-package
Reinstall a specific package, regardless of whether it's already installed. Implies --refresh-package

--require-hashes
Require a matching hash for each requirement.

By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash.

When --require-hashes is enabled, all requirements must include a hash or set of hashes, and all requirements must either be pinned to exact versions (e.g., ==1.0.0), or be specified via direct URL.

Hash-checking mode introduces a number of additional constraints:

Git dependencies are not supported. - Editable installations are not supported. - Local dependencies are not supported, unless they point to a specific wheel (.whl) or source archive (.zip, .tar.gz), as opposed to a directory.
May also be set with the UV_REQUIRE_HASHES environment variable.

--requirements, --requirement, -r requirements
Install all packages listed in the given requirements.txt or pylock.toml files.

If a pyproject.toml, setup.py, or setup.cfg file is provided, uv will extract the requirements for the relevant project.

If - is provided, then requirements will be read from stdin.

--resolution resolution
The strategy to use when selecting between the different compatible versions for a given package requirement.

By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (highest).

May also be set with the UV_RESOLUTION environment variable.

Possible values:

highest: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
lowest: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
lowest-direct: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies
--strict
Validate the Python environment after completing the installation, to detect packages with missing dependencies or other issues

--system
Install packages into the system Python environment.

By default, uv installs into the virtual environment in the current working directory or any parent directory. The --system option instructs uv to instead use the first Python found in the system PATH.

WARNING: --system is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments and should be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

May also be set with the UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON environment variable.

--target target
Install packages into the specified directory, rather than into the virtual or system Python environment. The packages will be installed at the top-level of the directory

--torch-backend torch-backend
The backend to use when fetching packages in the PyTorch ecosystem (e.g., cpu, cu126, or auto)

When set, uv will ignore the configured index URLs for packages in the PyTorch ecosystem, and will instead use the defined backend.

For example, when set to cpu, uv will use the CPU-only PyTorch index; when set to cu126, uv will use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.6.

The auto mode will attempt to detect the appropriate PyTorch index based on the currently installed CUDA drivers.

This option is in preview and may change in any future release.

May also be set with the UV_TORCH_BACKEND environment variable.

Possible values:

auto: Select the appropriate PyTorch index based on the operating system and CUDA driver version
cpu: Use the CPU-only PyTorch index
cu128: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.8
cu126: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.6
cu125: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.5
cu124: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.4

uv pip uninstall
Uninstall packages from an environment

Usage

uv pip uninstall [OPTIONS] <PACKAGE|--requirements <REQUIREMENTS>>
Arguments
PACKAGE
Uninstall all listed packages

Options
--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--break-system-packages
Allow uv to modify an EXTERNALLY-MANAGED Python installation.

WARNING: --break-system-packages is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments, when installing into Python installations that are managed by an external package manager, like apt. It should be used with caution, as such Python installations explicitly recommend against modifications by other package managers (like uv or pip).

May also be set with the UV_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES environment variable.

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
never: Disables colored output
--config-file config-file
The path to a uv.toml file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a pyproject.toml file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the UV_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--dry-run
Perform a dry run, i.e., don't actually uninstall anything but print the resulting plan

--help, -h
Display the concise help for this command

--keyring-provider keyring-provider
Attempt to use keyring for authentication for remote requirements files.

At present, only --keyring-provider subprocess is supported, which configures uv to use the keyring CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to disabled.

May also be set with the UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER environment variable.

Possible values:

disabled: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
subprocess: Use the keyring command for credential lookup
--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-break-system-packages
--no-cache, --no-cache-dir, -n
Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the UV_NO_CACHE environment variable.

--no-config
Avoid discovering configuration files (pyproject.toml, uv.toml).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the UV_NO_CONFIG environment variable.

--no-managed-python
Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--no-progress
Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the UV_NO_PROGRESS environment variable.

--no-python-downloads
Disable automatic downloads of Python.

--offline
Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--prefix prefix
Uninstall packages from the specified --prefix directory

--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--python, -p python
The Python interpreter from which packages should be uninstalled.

By default, uninstallation requires a virtual environment. A path to an alternative Python can be provided, but it is only recommended in continuous integration (CI) environments and should be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

See uv python for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

May also be set with the UV_PYTHON environment variable.

--quiet, -q
Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., -qq, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

--requirements, --requirement, -r requirements
Uninstall all packages listed in the given requirements files

--system
Use the system Python to uninstall packages.

By default, uv uninstalls from the virtual environment in the current working directory or any parent directory. The --system option instructs uv to instead use the first Python found in the system PATH.

WARNING: --system is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments and should be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

May also be set with the UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON environment variable.

--target target
Uninstall packages from the specified --target directory

--extra-index-url extra-index-url
(Deprecated: use --index instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to --index-url.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --index-url (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --extra-index-url flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--find-links, -f find-links
Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (.whl) or source distributions (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--help, -h
Display the concise help for this command

--index index
The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-dedupe
Do not de-duplicate repeated dependencies. Usually, when a package has already displayed its dependencies, further occurrences will not re-display its dependencies, and will include a (*) to indicate it has already been shown. This flag will cause those duplicates to be repeated

--no-index
Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via --find-links

--no-managed-python
Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--prune prune
Prune the given package from the display of the dependency tree

uv venv
Create a virtual environment.

By default, creates a virtual environment named .venv in the working directory. An alternative path may be provided positionally.

If in a project, the default environment name can be changed with the UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT environment variable; this only applies when run from the project root directory.

If a virtual environment exists at the target path, it will be removed and a new, empty virtual environment will be created.

When using uv, the virtual environment does not need to be activated. uv will find a virtual environment (named .venv) in the working directory or any parent directories.

Usage

uv venv [OPTIONS] [PATH]
Arguments
PATH
The path to the virtual environment to create.

Default to .venv in the working directory.

Relative paths are resolved relative to the working directory.

Options
--allow-existing
Preserve any existing files or directories at the target path.

By default, uv venv will remove an existing virtual environment at the given path, and exit with an error if the path is non-empty but not a virtual environment. The --allow-existing option will instead write to the given path, regardless of its contents, and without clearing it beforehand.

WARNING: This option can lead to unexpected behavior if the existing virtual environment and the newly-created virtual environment are linked to different Python interpreters.

--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

--no-progress
Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the UV_NO_PROGRESS environment variable.

--no-project, --no-workspace
Avoid discovering a project or workspace.

By default, uv searches for projects in the current directory or any parent directory to determine the default path of the virtual environment and check for Python version constraints, if any.

--no-python-downloads
Disable automatic downloads of Python.

--offline
Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--prompt prompt
Provide an alternative prompt prefix for the virtual environment.

By default, the prompt is dependent on whether a path was provided to uv venv. If provided (e.g, uv venv project), the prompt is set to the directory name. If not provided (uv venv), the prompt is set to the current directory's name.

If "." is provided, the current directory name will be used regardless of whether a path was provided to uv venv.

--refresh-package refresh-package
Refresh cached data for a specific package

--relocatable
Make the virtual environment relocatable.

A relocatable virtual environment can be moved around and redistributed without invalidating its associated entrypoint and activation scripts.

Note that this can only be guaranteed for standard console_scripts and gui_scripts. Other scripts may be adjusted if they ship with a generic #!python[w] shebang, and binaries are left as-is.

As a result of making the environment relocatable (by way of writing relative, rather than absolute paths), the entrypoints and scripts themselves will not be relocatable. In other words, copying those entrypoints and scripts to a location outside the environment will not work, as they reference paths relative to the environment itself.

--seed
Install seed packages (one or more of: pip, setuptools, and wheel) into the virtual environment.

Note that setuptools and wheel are not included in Python 3.12+ environments.

May also be set with the UV_VENV_SEED environment variable.

--system-site-packages
Give the virtual environment access to the system site packages directory.

Unlike pip, when a virtual environment is created with --system-site-packages, uv will not take system site packages into account when running commands like uv pip list or uv pip install. The --system-site-packages flag will provide the virtual environment with access to the system site packages directory at runtime, but will not affect the behavior of uv commands.

--verbose, -v
Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the RUST_LOG environment variable. (https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives)

uv build
Build Python packages into source distributions and wheels.

uv build accepts a path to a directory or source distribution, which defaults to the current working directory.

By default, if passed a directory, uv build will build a source distribution ("sdist") from the source directory, and a binary distribution ("wheel") from the source distribution.

uv build --sdist can be used to build only the source distribution, uv build --wheel can be used to build only the binary distribution, and uv build --sdist --wheel can be used to build both distributions from source.

If passed a source distribution, uv build --wheel will build a wheel from the source distribution.

Usage

uv build [OPTIONS] [SRC]
Arguments
SRC
The directory from which distributions should be built, or a source distribution archive to build into a wheel.

Defaults to the current working directory.

Options
--all-packages, --all
Builds all packages in the workspace.

The workspace will be discovered from the provided source directory, or the current directory if no source directory is provided.

If the workspace member does not exist, uv will exit with an error.

--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--build-constraints, --build-constraint, -b build-constraints
Constrain build dependencies using the given requirements files when building distributions.

Constraints files are requirements.txt-like files that only control the version of a build dependency that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will not trigger the inclusion of that package on its own.

May also be set with the UV_BUILD_CONSTRAINT environment variable.

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
never: Disables colored output
--config-file config-file

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --index flag.

May also be set with the UV_DEFAULT_INDEX environment variable.

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--exclude-newer exclude-newer
Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., 2006-12-02T02:07:43Z) and local dates in the same format (e.g., 2006-12-02) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER environment variable.

--extra-index-url extra-index-url
(Deprecated: use --index instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to --index-url.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --index-url (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --extra-index-url flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--find-links, -f find-links
Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (.whl) or source distributions (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the UV_FIND_LINKS environment variable.

--force-pep517
Always build through PEP 517, don't use the fast path for the uv build backend.

By default, uv won't create a PEP 517 build environment for packages using the uv build backend, but use a fast path that calls into the build backend directly. This option forces always using PEP 517.

--fork-strategy fork-strategy
The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (requires-python), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under fewest, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the UV_FORK_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

fewest: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
requires-python: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

--index index
The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by --default-index (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple --index flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with ./ or ../ on Unix or .\\, ..\\, ./ or ../ on Windows.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX environment variable.

--index-strategy index-strategy
The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (first-index). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_STRATEGY environment variable.

Possible values:

first-index: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
unsafe-first-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
unsafe-best-match: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index
--index-url, -i index-url
(Deprecated: use --default-index instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: https://pypi.org/simple).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the --extra-index-url flag.

May also be set with the UV_INDEX_URL environment variable.

--keyring-provider keyring-provider
Attempt to use keyring for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only --keyring-provider subprocess is supported, which configures uv to use the keyring CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to disabled.

May also be set with the UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER environment variable.

Possible values:

disabled: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
subprocess: Use the keyring command for credential lookup
--link-mode link-mode
The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

This option is only used when building source distributions.

Defaults to clone (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and hardlink on Linux and Windows.

May also be set with the UV_LINK_MODE environment variable.

Possible values:

clone: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
copy: Copy packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
hardlink: Hard link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
symlink: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the site-packages directory
--managed-python
Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the UV_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-binary
Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BINARY environment variable.

--no-binary-package no-binary-package
Don't install pre-built wheels for a specific package

May also be set with the UV_NO_BINARY_PACKAGE environment variable.

--no-build
Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD environment variable.

--no-build-isolation
Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION environment variable.

--no-build-isolation-package no-build-isolation-package
Disable isolation when building source distributions for a specific package.

Assumes that the packages' build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the UV_NO_CACHE environment variable.

--no-config
Avoid discovering configuration files (pyproject.toml, uv.toml).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the UV_NO_CONFIG environment variable.

--no-index
Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via --find-links

--no-managed-python
Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--no-progress
Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the UV_NO_PROGRESS environment variable.

--no-python-downloads
Disable automatic downloads of Python.

--no-sources
Ignore the tool.uv.sources table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

--no-verify-hashes
Disable validation of hashes in the requirements file.

By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash. To enforce hash validation, use --require-hashes.

May also be set with the UV_NO_VERIFY_HASHES environment variable.

--offline
Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--out-dir, -o out-dir
The output directory to which distributions should be written.

Defaults to the dist subdirectory within the source directory, or the directory containing the source distribution archive.

--package package
Build a specific package in the workspace.

The workspace will be discovered from the provided source directory, or the current directory if no source directory is provided.

If the workspace member does not exist, uv will exit with an error.

--prerelease prerelease
The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that only publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (if-necessary-or-explicit).

May also be set with the UV_PRERELEASE environment variable.

Possible values:

disallow: Disallow all pre-release versions
allow: Allow all pre-release versions
if-necessary: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
explicit: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
if-necessary-or-explicit: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements
--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--python, -p python
The Python interpreter to use for the build environment.

By default, builds are executed in isolated virtual environments. The discovered interpreter will be used to create those environments, and will be symlinked or copied in depending on the platform.

See uv python to view supported request formats.

May also be set with the UV_PYTHON environment variable.

--quiet, -q
Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., -qq, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

--refresh
Refresh all cached data

--refresh-package refresh-package
Refresh cached data for a specific package

--require-hashes
Require a matching hash for each requirement.

By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash.

When --require-hashes is enabled, all requirements must include a hash or set of hashes, and all requirements must either be pinned to exact versions (e.g., ==1.0.0), or be specified via direct URL.

Hash-checking mode introduces a number of additional constraints:

Git dependencies are not supported. - Editable installations are not supported. - Local dependencies are not supported, unless they point to a specific wheel (.whl) or source archive (.zip, .tar.gz), as opposed to a directory.
May also be set with the UV_REQUIRE_HASHES environment variable.

--resolution resolution
The strategy to use when selecting between the different compatible versions for a given package requirement.

By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (highest).

May also be set with the UV_RESOLUTION environment variable.

Possible values:

highest: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
lowest: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
lowest-direct: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies
--sdist

--verbose, -v
Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the RUST_LOG environment variable. (https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives)

--wheel
Build a binary distribution ("wheel") from the given directory

uv publish
Upload distributions to an index

Usage

uv publish [OPTIONS] [FILES]...
Arguments
FILES
Paths to the files to upload. Accepts glob expressions.

Defaults to the dist directory. Selects only wheels and source distributions, while ignoring other files.

Options
--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--check-url check-url
Check an index URL for existing files to skip duplicate uploads.

This option allows retrying publishing that failed after only some, but not all files have been uploaded, and handles error due to parallel uploads of the same file.

Before uploading, the index is checked. If the exact same file already exists in the index, the file will not be uploaded. If an error occurred during the upload, the index is checked again, to handle cases where the identical file was uploaded twice in parallel.

The exact behavior will vary based on the index. When uploading to PyPI, uploading the same file succeeds even without --check-url, while most other indexes error.

The index must provide one of the supported hashes (SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512).

May also be set with the UV_PUBLISH_CHECK_URL environment variable.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
always: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
never: Disables colored output
--config-file config-file
The path to a uv.toml file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a pyproject.toml file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the UV_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.

--directory directory
Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See --project to only change the project root directory.

--help, -h

The name of an index in the configuration to use for publishing.

The index must have a publish-url setting, for example:


[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "pypi"
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
publish-url = "https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/"
The index url will be used to check for existing files to skip duplicate uploads.

With these settings, the following two calls are equivalent:


uv publish --index pypi
uv publish --publish-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ --check-url https://pypi.org/simple
May also be set with the UV_PUBLISH_INDEX environment variable.

--keyring-provider keyring-provider
Attempt to use keyring for authentication for remote requirements files.

At present, only --keyring-provider subprocess is supported, which configures uv to use the keyring CLI to handle authentication.

--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--publish-url publish-url
The URL of the upload endpoint (not the index URL).

Note that there are typically different URLs for index access (e.g., https:://.../simple) and index upload.

Defaults to PyPI's publish URL (https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/).

May also be set with the UV_PUBLISH_URL environment variable.

--quiet, -q
Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., -qq, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

--token, -t token
The token for the upload.

Using a token is equivalent to passing __token__ as --username and the token as --password password.

May also be set with the UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN environment variable.

--trusted-publishing trusted-publishing
Configure using trusted publishing through GitHub Actions.

By default, uv checks for trusted publishing when running in GitHub Actions, but ignores it if it isn't configured or the workflow doesn't have enough permissions (e.g., a pull request from a fork).

uv cache prune
Prune all unreachable objects from the cache

Usage

uv cache prune [OPTIONS]
Options
--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run uv cache dir.

May also be set with the UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

--ci
Optimize the cache for persistence in a continuous integration environment, like GitHub Actions.

By default, uv caches both the wheels that it builds from source and the pre-built wheels that it downloads directly, to enable high-performance package installation. In some scenarios, though, persisting pre-built wheels may be undesirable. For example, in GitHub Actions, it's faster to omit pre-built wheels from the cache and instead have re-download them on each run. However, it typically is faster to cache wheels that are built from source, since the wheel building process can be expensive, especially for extension modules.

In --ci mode, uv will prune any pre-built wheels from the cache, but retain any wheels that were built from source.

--color color-choice
Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

auto: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support

uv cache dir
Show the cache directory.

By default, the cache is stored in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on Unix and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.

When --no-cache is used, the cache is stored in a temporary directory and discarded when the process exits.

An alternative cache directory may be specified via the cache-dir setting, the --cache-dir option, or the $UV_CACHE_DIR environment variable.

Note that it is important for performance for the cache directory to be located on the same file system as the Python environment uv is operating on.

--native-tls
Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled webpki-roots crate. The webpki-roots are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the UV_NATIVE_TLS environment variable.

--no-cache, --no-cache-dir, -n
Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the UV_NO_CACHE environment variable.

--no-config
Avoid discovering configuration files (pyproject.toml, uv.toml).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the UV_NO_CONFIG environment variable.

--no-managed-python
Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable.

--no-progress
Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the UV_NO_PROGRESS environment variable.

--no-python-downloads
Disable automatic downloads of Python.

--offline
Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the UV_OFFLINE environment variable.

--project project
Run the command within the given project directory.

All pyproject.toml, uv.toml, and .python-version files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (.venv).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See --directory to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the uv pip interface.

May also be set with the UV_PROJECT environment variable.

--quiet, -q
Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., -qq, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

--verbose, -v
Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the RUST_LOG environment variable. (https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives)

TARGET_VERSION
Update to the specified version. If not provided, uv will update to the latest version

Options
--allow-insecure-host, --trusted-host allow-insecure-host
Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., localhost), a host-port pair (e.g., localhost:8080), or a URL (e.g., https://localhost).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use --allow-insecure-host in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the UV_INSECURE_HOST environment variable.

--cache-dir cache-dir
Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv or $HOME/.cache/uv on macOS and Linux, and %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache on Windows.
